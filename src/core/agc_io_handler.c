  Filename:  ringbuffer_api.c
  Purpose:   Allows yaAGC to read/write i/o packets from/to simple ringbuffers
             in memory.  This file was based on NullAPI.c. Some code was copied
             from SocketAPI.c (where noted).
             Ring buffers were chosen so as to not slow down the AGC execution
             from possibly slow foreign function calls. The ringbuffers
             obviously have to be filled and emptied from other places where
             exact timing is not so relevant.
