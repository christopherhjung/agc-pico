 * Filename:	agc_engine_init.c
 * Purpose:	This is the function which initializes the AGC simulation,
 * 		from a file representing the binary image of core memory.
 * Compiler:	GNU gcc.
 * Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>
 * Reference:	http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/index.html
 * Mods:	04/05/03 RSB.	Began.
 *  		09/07/03 RSB.	Fixed data ordering in the core-rope image
 * 				file (to both endian CPU types to work).
 * 		11/26/03 RSB.	Up to now, a pseudo-linear space was used to
 * 				model internal AGC memory.  This was simply too
 * 				tricky to work with, because it was too hard to
 * 				understand the address conversions that were
 * 				taking place.  I now use a banked model much
 * 				closer to the true AGC memory map.
 * 		11/29/03 RSB.	Added the core-dump save/load.
 * 		05/06/04 RSB	Now use rfopen in looking for the binary.
 * 		07/12/04 RSB	Q is now 16 bits.
 * 		07/15/04 RSB	AGC data now aligned at bit 0 rather than 1.
 * 		07/17/04 RSB	I/O channels 030-033 now default to 077777
 * 				instead of 00000, since the signals are
 * 				supposed to be inverted.
 * 		02/27/05 RSB	Added the license exception, as required by
 * 				the GPL, for linking to Orbiter SDK libraries.
 * 		05/14/05 RSB	Corrected website references.
 * 	 	07/05/05 RSB	Added AllOrErasable.
 * 		07/07/05 RSB	On a resume, now restores 010 on up (rather
 * 				than 020 on up), on Hugh's advice.
 * 		02/26/06 RSB	Various changes requested by Mark Grant
 * 				to make it easier to integrate with Orbiter.
 * 				The main change is the addition of an
 * 				agc_load_binfile function.  Shouldn't affect
 * 				non-orbiter builds.
 * 		02/28/09 RSB	Fixed some compiler warnings for 64-bit machines.
 * 		03/18/09 RSB	Eliminated periodic messages about
 * 				core-dump creation when the DebugMode
 * 				flag is set.
 * 		03/27/09 RSB	I've noticed that about half the time, using
 * 				--resume causes the DSKY to become non-responsive.
 * 				I wonder if somehow not all the state variables
 * 				are being saved, and in particular not the
 * 				state related to interrupt.  (I haven't checked
 * 				this!)  Anyhow, there are extra state variables
 * 				in the agc_t structure which aren't being
 * 				saved or restored, so I'm adding all of these.
 * 		03/30/09 RSB	Added the Downlink variable to the core dumps.
 * 		08/14/16 OH	Issue #29 fix return value of agc_engine_init.
 * 		09/30/16 MAS    Added initialization of NightWatchman.
 * 		01/04/17 MAS    Added initialization of ParityFail.
 * 		01/30/17 MAS    Added support for heuristic loading of ROM files
 *                 		produced with --hardware, by looking for any set
 *                              parity bits. If such a file is detected, parity
 *                              bit checking is enabled.
 * 		03/09/17 MAS    Added initialization of SbyStillPressed.
 * 		03/26/17 MAS    Added initialization of previously-static things
 *                              from agc_engine.c that are now in agc_t.
 * 		03/27/17 MAS    Fixed a parity-related program loading bug and
 *                              added initialization of a new night watchman bit.
 *  		04/02/17 MAS	Added initialization of a couple of flags used
 *  				for simulation of the TC Trap hardware bug.
 * 		04/16/17 MAS    Added initialization of warning filter variables.
 * 		05/16/17 MAS    Enabled interrupts at startup.
 * 		05/31/17 RSB	Added --initialize-sunburst-37.
 * 		07/13/17 MAS	Added initialization of the three HANDRUPT traps.
 * 		05/13/21 MKF	Disabled UnblockSocket for the WASI target
 *  				(there are no sockets in wasi-libc)
 * 		01/29/24 MAS	Added initialization of RadarGateCounter.
